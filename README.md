# SVM_ML
##### Created for ML project by roll_numbers: I011,I013,I009 Batch 1 B.tech AI, SEM 4
##### The goal was to test, train and tune various machine learning models on movie review data and classify them as positive or negtaive.
##### The models tested were: SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. All of the models were built using Sklearn code from scratch for SVM is also created but was infeasible as it required a lot more memory than the sklearn class.
##### The models were deployed using streamlit. Note: only Naive Bayes and SVM were deployed as RandomForestClassifier led to errors. 
### folder description
##### The deployment code is provided in the streamlit_app folder and the models it uses are provided in the Pickle_files folder.
##### The model training code is provided in the Notebooks folder
### Model evaluation 
##### The models were evaluated using classification report and confusion matrix, both of which are coded from scratch.
##### The maximum accuracy achieved was using SVM, which was 87%.
The dataset was larger than 25 MB zipped hence here is the link for the dataset download: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
